Welcome to the GitHub repository of CrossBreeze!

## A short introduction

We are a software company, based in the Netherlands, specialized in data solutions. Through our expertise in model-driven development and code generation, we help organizations to realize data solutions faster and more efficiently.

We support organizations that develop their own data solutions with tools, advice and best practices. We also use our expertise to develop custom data solutions for organizations.

As part of our journey we sometimes see gaps in available tools and implement something new and shared it with the open-source community here on GitHub.
